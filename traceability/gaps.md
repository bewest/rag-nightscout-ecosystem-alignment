# Gaps

This document tracks gaps that block scenario implementation or conformance. These are not ideas or wish-list items—only concrete blockers.

## Active Gaps

### GAP-001: Nightscout lacks override supersession tracking

**Scenario**: [Override Supersede](../conformance/scenarios/override-supersede/)

**Description**: When a new override is created while another is active, Nightscout does not automatically mark the previous override as superseded. The old override simply expires based on duration.

**Impact**: 
- Cannot query "what override was active at time T" reliably
- No audit trail of override changes
- Data imported from Loop/Trio loses supersession relationships

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Add `superseded_by` and `superseded_at` fields to override documents
2. Create a new event type for supersession events
3. Handle in API layer rather than storage

**Status**: Under discussion

**Related**: 
- [ADR-001](../docs/90-decisions/adr-001-override-supersession.md)

### GAP-002: AAPS ProfileSwitch vs Override semantic mismatch

**Scenario**: [Override Supersede](../conformance/scenarios/override-supersede/)

**Description**: AAPS uses `ProfileSwitch` events rather than explicit overrides. A ProfileSwitch with percentage != 100 or modified targets functions like an override but has different semantics.

**Impact**:
- Mapping from AAPS data to alignment schema requires inference
- Some override patterns (like "return to normal after X hours") aren't explicit

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Define mapping rules for ProfileSwitch → Override conversion
2. Accept ProfileSwitch as a valid alternative representation
3. Create hybrid schema that accommodates both patterns

**Status**: Needs ADR

### GAP-003: No unified sync identity field across controllers

**Scenario**: All data synchronization scenarios

**Description**: Different AID controllers use different fields for deduplication and sync identity:
- AAPS uses `identifier`
- Loop uses `pumpId` + `pumpType` + `pumpSerial`
- xDrip uses `uuid`

**Impact**:
- Server-side deduplication is complex
- Reconciliation logic must know controller-specific patterns
- No single field for client-provided unique ID

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Define a standard `syncId` field all controllers should use
2. Controllers register their sync identity schema (inversion of control)
3. Accept current diversity and document mapping rules

**Status**: Under discussion

**Related**:
- [Treatments Schema](../externals/cgm-remote-monitor/docs/data-schemas/treatments-schema.md)
- [Data Collections Mapping](../mapping/nightscout/data-collections.md)

### GAP-AUTH-001: `enteredBy` field is unverified

**Scenario**: Authorization and audit scenarios

**Description**: The `enteredBy` field in treatments is a free-form nickname with no authentication verification. Anyone can claim to be anyone.

**Impact**:
- Cannot audit who actually made changes
- No accountability for data mutations
- Cannot implement authority-based conflict resolution

**Possible Solutions**:
1. OIDC Actor Identity - replace with verified claims
2. Add separate verified `actor` field alongside legacy `enteredBy`
3. Gateway-level identity injection

**Status**: Under discussion

**Related**:
- [OIDC Actor Identity Proposal](../externals/cgm-remote-monitor/docs/proposals/oidc-actor-identity-proposal.md)
- [Authorization Mapping](../mapping/nightscout/authorization.md)

---

### GAP-AUTH-002: No authority hierarchy in Nightscout

**Scenario**: Conflict resolution scenarios

**Description**: Nightscout treats all authenticated writes equally. There is no concept of authority levels (human > agent > controller).

**Impact**:
- Controllers can overwrite human-initiated overrides
- No protection for primary user decisions
- Cannot implement safe AI agent integration

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Implement authority levels in API layer
2. Add authority field to treatments
3. Handle in gateway layer (NRG)

**Status**: Proposed in conflict-resolution.md

**Related**:
- [Conflict Resolution Proposal](../externals/cgm-remote-monitor/docs/proposals/conflict-resolution.md)
- [Authority Model](../docs/10-domain/authority-model.md)
