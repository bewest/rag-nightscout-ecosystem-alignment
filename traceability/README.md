# Traceability Directory

This directory contains both **authored documentation** and **generated verification reports**.

## Authored Documents (Committed to Git)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gaps.md` | Documented semantic and technical gaps across the AID ecosystem |
| `requirements.md` | Derived requirements from gap analysis |
| `*-inventory.md` | Manual documentation inventories |
| `orphan-artifact-priorities.md` | Priority tiers for uncovered requirements |
| `stpa/` | STPA hazard analysis artifacts |
| `domain-matrices/` | REQ↔GAP↔Assertion traceability matrices |

## Domain Matrices

Cross-reference matrices linking requirements, gaps, and conformance assertions by domain.

| File | Domain | REQs | GAPs | Coverage |
|------|--------|------|------|----------|
| [`domain-matrices/sync-identity-matrix.md`](domain-matrices/sync-identity-matrix.md) | Sync & Identity | 32 | 25 | 47% REQ |
| [`domain-matrices/cgm-sources-matrix.md`](domain-matrices/cgm-sources-matrix.md) | CGM Sources | 18 | 52 | 0% REQ |

## STPA Subdirectory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `stpa/cross-project-patterns.md` | Cross-project UCA patterns and shared safety constraints |

## Generated Reports (Excluded from Git)

These files are regenerated by `make verify` and CI pipelines:

| File Pattern | Generator | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| `*-analysis.json/md` | `verify_coverage.py` | Requirement/gap coverage analysis |
| `assertion-trace.*` | `verify_assertions.py` | Assertion→requirement traceability |
| `terminology-consistency.*` | `verify_terminology.py` | Cross-project terminology validation |
| `refs-validation.*` | `verify_refs.py` | Code reference freshness checks |
| `coverage-matrix.*` | `gen_coverage.py` | Coverage matrix generation |
| `inventory.json/md` | `gen_inventory.py` | Workspace artifact inventory |

> **Note**: Archive files (`docs/archive/`) use abbreviated code paths (e.g., `.../`) for readability. These historical references are excluded from `verify_refs.py` validation.

## Running Verification

```bash
make verify              # Run all verification tools
make verify-refs         # Validate code references
make verify-coverage     # Analyze requirement/gap coverage
make verify-terminology  # Check terminology consistency
make verify-assertions   # Trace assertions to requirements
```

## Why Generated Reports Are Gitignored

1. **Freshness**: Reports should reflect current state, not stale commits
2. **CI Integration**: Automation regenerates on every pipeline run
3. **Reduced Noise**: Avoids noisy diffs from regenerated timestamps
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Authored docs are the source; reports are derived
