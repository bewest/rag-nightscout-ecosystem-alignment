# Sync Identity Requirements

Domain-specific requirements extracted from requirements.md.
See [requirements.md](requirements.md) for the index.

### REQ-BATCH-001: Response Order Must Match Request Order

**Statement**: When processing batch uploads, the server MUST return responses in the same order as the input array.

**Rationale**: Loop caches syncIdentifier→objectId mappings based on response position. Mismatched order causes wrong ID assignments.

**Scenarios**:
- Batch Treatment Upload
- Batch Entry Upload

**Verification**:
- Submit batch of 5 treatments with distinct syncIdentifiers
- Verify response[i]._id corresponds to request[i].syncIdentifier
- Verify no position swaps occur

**Gap Reference**: GAP-BATCH-002

### REQ-BATCH-002: Deduplicated Items Return Existing ID

**Statement**: When a batch item is deduplicated, the server MUST return the existing document's `_id` at that position, not omit it.

**Rationale**: Clients expect N responses for N requests. Missing positions corrupt sync state.

**Scenarios**:
- Batch with Duplicates
- Network Retry Handling

**Verification**:
- Submit batch with one duplicate item
- Verify response array has same length as request
- Verify duplicate position returns existing _id

**Gap Reference**: GAP-BATCH-003

---

### REQ-BATCH-003: Partial Failure Response Format

**Statement**: When some items in a batch fail validation, the server SHOULD return a response array with success/failure indicators per item, preserving order.

**Rationale**: Clients need to know which items succeeded and which failed to update local state.

**Scenarios**:
- Mixed Validity Batch

**Verification**:
- Submit batch with valid and invalid items
- Verify response indicates status per item
- Verify response order matches request

## Timezone Requirements

---

### REQ-SYNC-001: Document WebSocket API

**Statement**: The specification MUST document all Socket.IO events, payloads, and authentication requirements.

**Rationale**: Enables third-party clients to implement real-time sync correctly.

**Scenarios**:
- Client connecting to receive dataUpdate
- Custom dashboard implementation
- Mobile app Socket.IO integration

**Verification**:
- All events documented with payload schemas
- Authentication flow documented
- Error handling documented

**Gap Reference**: GAP-API-006

---

---

### REQ-SYNC-002: Consistent Sync Identity Across API Versions

**Statement**: All API versions MUST generate consistent `identifier` fields using the same algorithm.

**Rationale**: Prevents duplicates when clients switch between v1 and v3 APIs.

**Scenarios**:
- V1 upload followed by v3 update
- Migration from v1 to v3 client
- Mixed-version client ecosystem

**Verification**:
- V1 uploads include identifier field
- Same document matches across API versions
- Migration path documented

**Gap Reference**: GAP-SYNC-009

---

### REQ-SYNC-003: Sync Status Response

**Statement**: Upload endpoints SHOULD return sync metadata including insert/update counts and identifiers.

**Rationale**: Enables clients to verify sync success and handle retries appropriately.

**Scenarios**:
- Client retry after network failure
- Bulk upload status tracking
- Conflict detection

**Verification**:
- Response includes inserted/updated counts
- Response includes document identifiers
- Conflicts are reported

**Gap Reference**: GAP-SYNC-010

---

## Authentication Requirements

---

### REQ-TZ-001: DST Transition Notification

**Statement**: AID systems with pumps that cannot handle DST SHOULD notify users before DST transitions.

**Rationale**: Most pump drivers cannot automatically adjust for DST. User intervention is required.

**Scenarios**:
- DST Transition Handling

**Verification**:
- Configure pump with `canHandleDST() = false`
- Approach DST boundary (±24 hours)
- Verify user notification generated

**Gap Reference**: GAP-TZ-001

---

---

### REQ-TZ-002: Preserve Client utcOffset

**Statement**: The server SHOULD preserve client-provided `utcOffset` values when they are valid, rather than recalculating from dateString.

**Rationale**: Client may have authoritative timezone information; server recalculation may lose precision.

**Scenarios**:
- Cross-Timezone Sync

**Verification**:
- Upload treatment with explicit utcOffset
- Download and verify utcOffset preserved
- Compare with dateString-derived offset

**Gap Reference**: GAP-TZ-003
