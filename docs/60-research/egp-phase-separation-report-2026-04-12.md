# EGP Phase Separation Research — Round 1 Report

**Date**: 2026-04-12
**Experiments**: EXP-2621, EXP-2622
**Data**: 9 patients, ~180 days each, 5-min resolution (803K rows)

## Problem Statement

The metabolic engine's meal detector classifies any unexplained glucose rise as a
"meal," producing 46.5% unannounced events population-wide. We hypothesized that
many of these false-positive meals are actually EGP (Endogenous Glucose Production)
fluctuations operating on 10-72h timescales — glycogen repletion, gluconeogenesis
adaptation, circadian hepatic output — rather than actual eating events.

**Core Question**: Can we separate EGP supply signal (10-72h) from true meal
signal (3-8h) in the metabolic residual?

## Experiments

### EXP-2621: Residual Event Census & Spectral Decomposition

**Purpose**: Characterize detected "meal" events by time-of-day and measure what
fraction of residual variance falls in the EGP frequency band (>8h periods).

**Hypotheses & Results**:

| ID | Hypothesis | Threshold | Result | Verdict |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| H1 | ≥40% of overnight (00-06) events have <5g estimated carbs | ≥40% | 9.5% median | **FAIL** |
| H2 | EGP-band spectral power ≥20% of total residual | ≥20% in 6/9 | 0/9 (3.6-8.6%) | **FAIL** |
| H3 | ρ(unannounced%, EGP-band) ≥ 0.5 | ≥0.5, p<0.05 | ρ=0.43, p=0.24 | **FAIL** |

**Key Findings**:

1. **High-frequency noise dominates the residual (84-93%)**. The EGP band
   (8-24h periods) accounts for only 3.6-8.6% of residual variance. The
   existing circadian model in the metabolic engine may already capture most
   slow EGP variation, leaving primarily noise.

2. **Overnight events are real-sized, not phantom bursts**. Only 9.5% of
   overnight detected events are <5g estimated carbs. These are substantial
   residual bursts, suggesting either genuine late-night eating or large EGP
   excursions that mimic meal-sized signals.

3. **Patient heterogeneity is extreme**:
   - Patient k: 2.5 events/day, 93% unannounced, highest EGP-band (8.6%)
   - Patient b: 0 detected events (very well-controlled or no residual bursts)
   - Patient a: 2.4 events/day, 40% unannounced (moderate)

4. **Meal distribution across time blocks** (patient a, representative):
   - Overnight: 1.0/day — surprisingly high
   - Breakfast: 0.5/day
   - Dinner: 0.3/day
   - The overnight block has MORE events than any individual meal block

5. **Spectral band distribution** (population mean):
   - Ultra-low (>24h): 1.3%
   - EGP (8-24h): 5.3%
   - Meal (3-8h): 5.2%
   - High-freq (<3h): 88.2%

**Interpretation**: The EGP signal is NOT easily separable from meals via FFT of
the full residual. This may be because: (a) the circadian model already absorbs
most EGP variation, (b) EGP fluctuations produce rapid glucose changes that
appear high-frequency after insulin response, or (c) EGP truly has less variance
than insulin timing/dosing noise.

### EXP-2622: Multi-Day EGP Trajectory & Glycogen State Estimation

**Purpose**: Use overnight fasting windows as "natural experiments" to estimate
EGP rate, then correlate with prior-day carb loads and glycogen proxy.

**Hypotheses & Results**:

| ID | Hypothesis | Threshold | Result | Verdict |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| H1 | Prior-24h carbs explain ≥10% of overnight drift variance | R²≥0.10 | R²=0.037 | **FAIL** |
| H2 | Night-to-night drift autocorrelation ≥0.3 | median≥0.3 | median=-0.002 | **FAIL** |
| H3 | Glycogen proxy improves prediction over raw 24h carbs | ΔR²≥0.03 | ΔR²=0.046 | **PASS** |

**Key Findings**:

1. **48h carbs are more predictive than 24h carbs (r=-0.303 vs r=-0.193)**. This
   is the strongest finding: the glucose system has memory beyond 24h. The 48h
   correlation is highly significant (p=0.0004). This supports the hypothesis that
   EGP operates on multi-day timescales.

2. **Glycogen proxy (τ=24h exponential accumulator) explains 8.3% of overnight
   drift variance** — more than double the 3.7% from raw 24h carb sum. The
   exponential accumulator captures the decaying influence of past meals better
   than a simple sum. H3 PASSES.

3. **The correlation is NEGATIVE: more prior carbs → lower overnight drift**.
   This is physiologically consistent:
   - More carbs → more insulin → lower overnight glucose
   - Or: more carbs → more glycogen → body doesn't need to activate
     gluconeogenesis → less dawn phenomenon
   - Confounding is likely (patients who eat more may have higher basal rates)

4. **Night-to-night drift is essentially random (autocorr ≈ 0)**.
   Only patient f shows meaningful persistence (r=0.28). This argues against a
   strong slowly-varying EGP state — OR the overnight drift measure is too noisy
   (σ=13 mg/dL/hr) to detect the signal. The signal-to-noise ratio is poor.

5. **Only 4/9 patients have sufficient clean overnight windows**:
   - a: 33 windows, mean drift +4.5 mg/dL/hr (rising glucose)
   - d: 37 windows, mean drift +9.1 mg/dL/hr (significant dawn phenomenon)
   - f: 36 windows, mean drift -2.1 mg/dL/hr (slightly falling, good basal)
   - k: 25 windows, mean drift +0.8 mg/dL/hr (nearly flat)

## Disconfirmed Hypotheses & Null Findings

1. **EGP is NOT a dominant signal in the residual spectrum**. The pre-existing
   circadian model (4-harmonic fit in metabolic_engine.py) likely already captures
   most EGP variation. The residual after circadian subtraction is dominated by
   high-frequency noise (88%), not slow EGP oscillations.

2. **Overnight "meals" are NOT phantom micro-events**. They have substantial
   estimated carb sizes (>5g in 90% of cases), suggesting either genuine
   late-night eating or that the residual burst magnitude from EGP fluctuations
   is large enough to mimic real meals.

3. **Night-to-night EGP state is NOT persistent**. The near-zero autocorrelation
   means consecutive nights are essentially independent, contrary to the
   hypothesis that glycogen cycling creates multi-day drift patterns.

## Confirmed/Promising Findings

1. **Multi-day carb history matters (48h >> 24h)**: The 48h carb window is 57%
   more correlated with overnight drift than 24h (r=-0.303 vs r=-0.193). This
   is actionable: basal recommendations should consider 48h carb context, not
   just same-day eating.

2. **Glycogen proxy works**: The exponential accumulator (τ=24h) captures more
   variance than raw carb sums. This model could be integrated into the metabolic
   engine as a "metabolic context" feature.

3. **Patient d has strong dawn phenomenon (+9.1 mg/dL/hr)**. EGP-related? This
   patient also has 72% unannounced events, suggesting the meal detector is
   picking up dawn glucose rises as "meals."

## Revised Hypotheses for Round 2

Based on Round 1 findings, we revise our approach:

1. **The EGP signal is NOT in the frequency domain** — it's in the amplitude and
   timing of overnight drift. The spectral approach was wrong; the correct signal
   is the drift rate during clean fasting windows, modulated by multi-day context.

2. **EGP-subtracted meal detection (EXP-2623) should focus on IOB-corrected
   overnight drift** rather than spectral band subtraction. Use the glycogen
   proxy to predict expected overnight drift, then subtract from the residual
   before meal detection.

3. **For EXP-2624 (insulin phase lag)**, look at correction bolus response
   windows rather than overnight drift, since overnight autocorrelation is too
   noisy.

4. **New hypothesis**: Dawn phenomenon events (00-06h, large positive drift)
   may be separable from true overnight snacks by IOB context — if IOB is low
   and drift is positive, it's EGP; if IOB is elevated, it's post-meal.
