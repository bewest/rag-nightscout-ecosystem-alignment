PROMPT Run complete verification suite.

PROMPT 1. REFERENCE VALIDATION:
  - Check all file:line references resolve
  - Flag broken external links
  - Verify repository paths exist

PROMPT 2. COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
  - Requirements with/without scenarios
  - Gaps with/without remediation
  - Overall coverage statistics

PROMPT 3. TERMINOLOGY CONSISTENCY:
  - Cross-project term mapping completeness
  - Conflicting definitions
  - Missing canonical names

PROMPT 4. ASSERTION TRACING:
  - Assertions linked to requirements
  - Orphan assertions
  - Requirements without tests

PROMPT Generate unified verification report:
  - Pass/Fail status for each check
  - Summary statistics
  - Priority issues to fix
  - Recommended next steps
