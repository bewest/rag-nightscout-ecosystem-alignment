PROMPT Compare implementations across the Nightscout ecosystem.

PROMPT Analyze treatment sync behavior:
  - Loop → Nightscout sync fields
  - AAPS → Nightscout sync fields
  - Trio → Nightscout sync fields
  - xDrip+ → AAPS → Nightscout chain

PROMPT Compare DeviceStatus structures:
  - Loop's predicted glucose format
  - oref0/AAPS prediction curves (IOB, COB, UAM, ZT)
  - Trio's OpenAPS structure

PROMPT Identify alignment issues:
  1. Same concept, different field names
  2. Same field name, different semantics
  3. Missing fields in some implementations
  4. Unit/format inconsistencies

PROMPT For each misalignment:
  - Document the difference
  - Identify which projects are affected
  - Suggest canonical representation
  - Link to relevant GAP-ID if exists

PROMPT Generate alignment report:
  - Summary of cross-project differences
  - Recommended standardizations
  - Priority fixes for interoperability
