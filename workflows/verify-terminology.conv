PROMPT Verify terminology consistency across the Nightscout ecosystem.

PROMPT Check the terminology matrix for:
  1. Missing entries (terms used in docs but not mapped)
  2. Conflicting definitions (same term, different meanings)
  3. Deprecated terms still in use
  4. New terms needing documentation

PROMPT Cross-reference with project mappings:
  - Loop terminology
  - AAPS/oref0 terminology
  - Nightscout API terminology
  - xDrip+ terminology

PROMPT Identify terms that need:
  - Standardization (pick canonical name)
  - Disambiguation (clarify context)
  - Deprecation (mark as legacy)

PROMPT Generate consistency report with:
  - Terms with inconsistencies
  - Suggested canonical names
  - Cross-project mapping gaps
